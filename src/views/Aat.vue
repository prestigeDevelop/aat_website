		<h5>Animal Assisted Therapy</h5>
		<section class="content">
			<p>
				Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT) is a relatively new practice in Canada, and isn't widespread and implemented like in
				other countries (i.e USA, UK, Israel). With that it's active and experiential approach is becoming popular amongst
				all.
			</p>
			<p>
				The activities involved depend on client preferences and needs as well as the individual goals. AAT helps clients with
				a multitude of goals, as it enhances an individual's physical, emotional and social well-being, thus improving
				self-esteem, reducing anxiety, providing help with PTSD symptoms and facilitating healing. AAT has been used to
				promote socialization, provide distraction, create a comfortable environment that encourages the client to express
				themselves, and enhance trust. It can be used with most mind/body therapies that help with relaxation and calming the
				stress response.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mental-emotional level, the encounter with the animal is a mirror of the soul. The client’s mood, feelings, and
				behaviors reflected through the animal. It allows the client to experience their internal emotions through something
				external from themselves. The animal can relax the client and reduce their stress and anxiety. It enables and
				facilitates the expression of emotions, releasing and redirecting those emotions towards the animal who then takes
				those emotions and rids the client of those negative feelings. The connection to the animal, treating it and
				interacting with it, gives a sense of meaning and increases a sense of peace and quiet. It provides confidence and
				pride, strengthening the sense of ability and self-esteem of the client. The closeness and togetherness that is
				created between the animal and the client throughout this process relieves loneliness, where the animal becomes a
				model on how the client can interact with different people in their own environment. Through the treatment of the
				animal, experiencing its reactions, its fears, its potential for anger, we can work on the reducing the client’s
				feelings of anger, frustration and aggression and foster self-control and emotional regulation. Therefore, the
				meetings between the client and animal can help treat anxiety and depression.
			</p>
			<p>
				Social level, the animal reflects models of communication and relationships, helping the patient to understand his
				engagements to the other people in their life. Working with a variety of animals with different characteristics and
				behavior patterns, and using that animal to symbolize different aspects of a client’s life, will help the client to
				understand their behavior and teach them to "read" social situations. This process serves as a mirror and enables the
				client to see how they look and are being understood by those around them. The animal becomes a mediator and bridge
				between the client and their immediate environment. Getting to know the animal and developing that communication and
				relationship with the animal (not always verbally), brings a better level of sensitivity, empathy, and acknowledgement
				of others’ needs. It will help improve their social skills and interpersonal communication. It helps in creating
				meaningful connections more naturally, allowing the client to have an alternative experience than the one they have
				experienced in the past. This allows them to engage in a different interaction and outcome than what they are used to.
			</p>
			<p>
				The result of learning, processing patterns and internalizing that information with the animal, decreases the levels
				of psychological distress that has developed due to difficult past social interaction. This therapeutic bond develops
				the client’s awareness of others, their compassion, their empathy, their patience, and their listening skills.
				Creating connection to the animal, treating and caring for it. This encourages accountability, commitment, and the
				ability to plan and implement client's goals. It promotes effective organization, cooperation and teamwork. In
				addition this process can help develop practice in delayed gratification and concentration.
			</p>
			<p>
				Physiological level, the encounters with animals produce experiences that sharpen the senses. The encounter with the
				animal enables different sensational experiences - furry, feathery, warm, prickly, smooth, cool. Touching and handling
				the animal helps in accepting their own physical image, developing fine motor skills and coordination, and has
				rehabilitative aspects. Such work can help reduce concentration problems, enlarge the attention- concentration range
				and create inner peace. Even in cases of anxiety, along with emotional treatment, just interacting with the animal can
				reduce anxiety. For example, touching a welcoming animal promotes relaxation and calmness through the release of
				beta-endorphins and a significant decline in blood pressure and cortisol levels.
			</p>
			<p>
				In terms of experiential learning, the encounter with the animals and learning about them exposes the client to
				knowledge, research, and observations. It develops thinking and learning skills that encourage natural curiosity as
				well as experiencing success every time they accomplish a new task with the animal.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the most fundamental advantages of animal assisted therapy over other therapeutic modalities is that it
				provides the client a much-needed opportunity to give affection as well as receive it. It is this reciprocity - rare
				among medical therapies - that makes AAT a unique, and valuable route to healing.
