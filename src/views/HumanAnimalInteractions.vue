					The relationship between people and animals has been long-standing and has played a significant role in human
					history. From working animals to companion animals, animals have been an integral part of human life and have
					had a profound impact on our emotional, psychological, and physical well-being. In the past century this
					connection has led to the development of Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT), a form of therapy that integrates
					animals and various activities involving animals. With a goal to help individuals promote their development,
					overcome challenges, provide support and promote their therapeutic goals.
				</p>
				<p>
					AAT has been found to be effective in treating a wide range of mental health conditions, including anxiety,
					depression, and stress. It is based on the idea that the bond between humans and animals can have a
					therapeutic effect. Communicating through the animal, receiving immediate feedback, addressing different needs
					and fulfilling various task with therapist’s navigation and facilitation, promotes awareness, learning,
					adaptation, self empowerment that lead to healing and reducing symptoms of psychological distress.
				</p>
				<p>
					Studies have shown that animal-assisted therapy can be particularly beneficial for individuals who struggle
					with emotional regulation. AAT has also been found to improve mood, reduce feelings of loneliness and
					isolation, and increase feelings of social connectedness. For example, a study conducted at the University of
					Missouri found that children with autism (2022) who participated in animal-assisted therapy showed significant
					improvement in social interaction, communication, and emotional regulation compared to a control group.
					Students pursuing higher education reported improvement in their Mental Health related to anxiety due to AAT
					sessions.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition to its benefits for individuals with mental health conditions, AAT has also been shown to improve
					family relationships. Family animal assisted therapy sessions can help families to connect and build stronger
					bonds. The incorporation of animals can make therapy more engaging, enjoyable for children and youth while
					observing animal interactions, reflecting, projecting, processing and understanding with the therapist’s
					support. A study conducted at the University of North Texas found that families who participated in
					animal-assisted family therapy reported improved communication and increased feelings of closeness and
					togetherness.
				</p>
				<p>
					The development of animal-assisted therapy has been driven by the recognition that animals can have a positive
					impact on human health and well-being. Different animals are specifically chosen for different clients
					focusing on individual goals to provide therapeutic support and learning experiences and they are typically
					utilized in conjunction with a certified mental health professional to help individuals with a wide range of
					emotional and behavioural regulation issues.
				</p>
				<p>
					AAT involves a therapist working with an animal/s to help the individual achieve specific therapeutic goals.
					The therapist utilizes the animal to facilitate activities, or performing tasks with the animal or for the
					animal.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is important to note that Animal-Assisted Therapy is not a one-size-fits-all approach, and it is not
					appropriate for everyone. Individuals with specific phobias or allergies to animals may not be good candidates
					for AAT, and it is important to work with a mental health professional to determine if AAT is appropriate for
					a particular individual.
				</p>
				<p>
					In conclusion, the connection between people and animals has led to the development of animal-assisted
					therapy, a form of therapy that has been found to be effective in treating a wide range of mental health
					conditions, including anxiety, depression, PTSD symptoms, OCD, Autism Spectrum, emotional regulation, ADHD,
					ADD, behavioural challenges and stress. AAT has also been shown to improve family relationships and can
					provide a unique and engaging therapeutic experience for children and youth. While it is not appropriate for
					everyone, a trained animal assisted therapist utilizing animal assisted therapy and can provide a helpful
					tools for improving emotional and behavioural regulation for those who can benefit from it.
